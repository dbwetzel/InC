## Terry Riley's "In C" for Web Audio Ensemble
_Arrangement of Terry Riley's "In C" for laptops or mobile devices using Tone.js By David B Wetzel, Griffin Moe, and George K. Thiruvathukal_

This is an ongoing project of the Loyola University (Chicago) Technology Ensemble (LUTE)

This is a mobile-friendly web app designed to enable group performances of Terry Riley's classic 1964 minimalist composition "In C" by participants with little or no musical or computer science training. The aim is to avoid technical barriers to musical ensemble participation and to encourage listening and in-person interaction.
